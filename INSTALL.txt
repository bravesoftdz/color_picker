There are pre-compiled binaries in /bin for Windows 32 bit, Linx 32/64 bit.

To compile Color_Picker, uses Free Pascal Compiler and fpGUI tool-kit.

The sources are in /src.

You may have to edit extrafpc.cfg according with your fpGUI path.
PS: For Windows => ~/gdi
    For Unix => ~/x11

To compile it, do in console =>

> fpc color_picker @extrafpc.cfg
